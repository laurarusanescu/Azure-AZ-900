# Azure Resource Organization Structure

Azure provides a hierarchical structure for organizing resources effectively. This structure consists of four levels:

## **1. Resources**
- **Definition**: Instances of Azure services (e.g., Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, SQL Databases).
- **Purpose**: The fundamental building blocks that provide functionality in Azure.

## **2. Resource Groups**
- **Definition**: Logical containers for resources.
- **Purpose**:
  - Organize related resources (e.g., web apps, databases, and storage accounts).
  - Simplify resource deployment and management.

## **3. Subscriptions**
- **Definition**: A grouping of user accounts and the resources created by those accounts.
- **Purpose**:
  - **Resource Limits**: Subscriptions have quotas for the amount of resources that can be used.
  - **Cost Management**: Allows organizations to manage budgets and resource usage by teams or projects.

## **4. Management Groups**
- **Definition**: Containers for managing multiple subscriptions.
- **Purpose**:
  - Apply **access**, **policies**, and **compliance rules** across all subscriptions within the group.
  - Inherit conditions: All subscriptions automatically inherit the settings of their parent management group.

### **Key Insights**:
- **Bottom-Up Approach**: Start with resources, organize them into resource groups, group these into subscriptions, and oversee multiple subscriptions with management groups.
- **Efficiency**: This hierarchy allows organizations to manage resources, access, policies, and costs efficiently.

# Azure Subscriptions and Management Groups

## **Azure Subscriptions**
- **Definition**: Logical units that link Azure accounts (identities in Azure AD) to access Azure services.
- **Functions**:
  - Authenticate and authorize access.
  - Provision and manage resources like VMs, Storage Accounts, and Databases.

### **Types of Subscription Boundaries**:
1. **Billing Boundary**:
   - **Purpose**: Determine how costs are organized.
   - **Feature**: Each subscription generates separate billing reports and invoices.
2. **Access Control Boundary**:
   - **Purpose**: Manage access policies at the subscription level.
   - **Example**: Use subscriptions to limit resource access by department or project.

### **Reasons to Create Additional Subscriptions**:
- **Environment Separation**: Distinguish development, testing, and production.
- **Cost Management**: Separate costs by teams, projects, or workloads.
- **Compliance and Isolation**: Isolate data for compliance or security.
- **Resource Limits**: Avoid hard limits like max Azure ExpressRoute circuits (10 per subscription).

---

## **Azure Management Groups**
- **Definition**: Containers for organizing multiple subscriptions for unified policy, access, and governance.
- **Inheritance**:
  - Policies applied at a management group level are automatically inherited by all subscriptions and resources within that group.

### **Key Features**:
- **Enterprise-Grade Governance**:
  - Apply policies like limiting VM locations to specific regions.
  - Prevent changes to policies by subscription or resource owners.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Assign roles at the management group level for streamlined access across subscriptions.

### **Hierarchy Rules**:
- Up to 10,000 management groups per directory.
- A hierarchy supports up to six levels of depth (excluding root and subscription levels).
- Each management group or subscription can have only one parent.
- A management group can have multiple children.

### **Use Cases**:
1. **Governance**: Centralized application of policies (e.g., restricting VM locations).
2. **Access Management**: Assign user access across subscriptions using a single RBAC role at the management group level.
3. **Resource Organization**: Build a hierarchy of management groups and subscriptions for streamlined management.

### **Management Group Facts**:
- Subscriptions and management groups are part of a single hierarchy within a directory.
- All subscriptions under a management group must trust the same Azure AD tenant.
