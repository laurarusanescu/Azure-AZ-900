# Cloud Service Models and Categories

## Cloud Service Models

Cloud service models define the levels of shared responsibility between the cloud provider and the cloud tenant. The main models are:

### 1. **IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service)**

- **Description**: The cloud provider manages the hardware, and the tenant manages the operating system and network. Example: **Azure Virtual Machines**.
- **Advantages**: No upfront costs, agility, flexibility, and consumption-based pricing.

### 2. **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)**

- **Description**: The cloud provider manages virtual machines and networking, while the tenant deploys applications. Example: **Azure App Services**.
- **Advantages**: No hardware costs, quick deployment, and productivity gains for developers.

### 3. **SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)**

- **Description**: The provider manages everything, including applications. The tenant only provides data. Example: **Microsoft Office 365**.
- **Advantages**: No upfront costs, pay-as-you-go, and flexibility to access software from anywhere.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Models

### **IaaS**: 
- **Advantages**: Full control, no upfront costs, pay-per-use, flexible.
- **Disadvantages**: More management required.

### **PaaS**: 
- **Advantages**: Fast deployment, no hardware management, focuses on app development.
- **Disadvantages**: Platform limitations may affect some applications.

### **SaaS**: 
- **Advantages**: Fast access to software, pay-per-use, no infrastructure management.
- **Disadvantages**: Limited control over features.

## What is Serverless Computing?

Serverless computing allows developers to focus on code without managing infrastructure. The cloud provider automatically handles provisioning and scaling. It is event-driven and scalable, helping developers focus on business logic rather than infrastructure.

## Summary

- **IaaS**: Full control over infrastructure.
- **PaaS**: Managed platform for app deployment.
- **SaaS**: Fully managed software applications.
- **Serverless**: Focus on code, no infrastructure management.
