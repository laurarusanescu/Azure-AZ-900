# Artificial Intelligence Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to software systems that can perceive their environment and take actions to achieve their goals. AI aims to create systems that can learn and adapt on their own without being explicitly programmed.

## Two Approaches to AI

### 1. Deep Learning
- Modeled on the human brain's neural network.
- Learns and grows through experience, discovering patterns and insights.
  
### 2. Machine Learning (ML)
- A data-driven technique that uses existing data to train models.
- Predictions and trends are made based on data patterns without explicit programming.

## Applications of Machine Learning
- **Product Recommendations**: Suggesting products based on past purchases or interests.
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns from millions of data points.

# Introduction to Primary Offerings

In this session, you'll be introduced to three primary offerings:
1. **Azure DevOps Services**
2. **GitHub and GitHub Actions**
3. **Azure DevTest Labs**

Each offering is aimed at a specific audience and use case and provides a diverse set of tools, services, programmatic APIs, and more. Let’s dive in!

## 1. Azure DevOps Services

Azure DevOps is a suite of services that addresses every stage of the software development lifecycle. Here’s a breakdown of its core components:

- **Azure Boards**: An agile project management suite that includes Kanban boards, reporting, and tracking work from high-level epics to work items and issues. It visually displays work at various stages of a process.
  
- **Azure Repos**: A centralized source code repository for software development, DevOps, engineering, and documentation professionals to publish their code for review and collaboration.
  
- **Azure Pipelines**: A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline automation tool.
  
- **Azure Test Plans**: An automated testing tool that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality before a software release.
  
- **Azure Artifacts**: A repository for hosting artifacts such as compiled source code, which can be fed into testing or deployment pipeline steps.

Azure DevOps is a mature toolset that originated as on-premises server software and evolved into a software-as-a-service offering from Microsoft.

## 2. GitHub and GitHub Actions

GitHub is one of the world’s most popular code repositories for open-source software, and GitHub Actions provides workflow automation. Here are the key features:

- **GitHub**:
  - A **shared source code repository** with tools for code reviews, issue reporting, discussion, and tracking.
  - **Project Management**: Includes Kanban boards, issue reporting, and discussion tracking.
  - **CI/CD Pipeline Automation**: Supports automation of the software delivery pipeline.
  - **Wiki for Collaborative Documentation**: Enables teams to document and share information collaboratively.
  - **Cloud or On-Premises**: GitHub can be hosted in the cloud or on your own infrastructure.

- **GitHub Actions**:
  - **Workflow Automation**: GitHub Actions helps automate various lifecycle events. For example, automating a CI/CD toolchain where the output of one tool becomes the input of the next.
  - **Toolchain**: Combines software tools that assist in software delivery, development, and management throughout the system development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Choosing Between Azure DevOps and GitHub

- **GitHub**: Focused on individual developers contributing to open-source projects. It is lighter-weight and more oriented toward public repositories.
- **Azure DevOps**: A heavier, enterprise-focused tool that offers project management and planning tools, as well as more granular access control.

**Integration**: You’re not limited to just one of these platforms. You can mix and match as needed (e.g., using GitHub Repos with Azure Boards for work item tracking).

## 3. Azure DevTest Labs

Azure DevTest Labs helps manage VMs for developers and testers to ensure apps work across various operating systems. Here’s how it works:

- **Automated VM Management**: DevTest Labs automates the process of building, setting up, and tearing down virtual machines (VMs) containing your software builds.
  
- **Multi-Environment Testing**: Developers and testers can perform tests across different environments and builds without manual setup.

- **Pre-Created Lab Environments**: You can provision pre-created lab environments with required configurations and tools installed, saving time for developers and QA professionals.

### How Azure DevTest Labs Works:

1. **Provision VMs**: If you need to test on an older version of an OS, DevTest Labs can set up everything automatically.
2. **Shut Down VMs**: Once testing is complete, the VMs can be shut down and decommissioned to save money.
3. **Cost Management**: Admins can control costs by limiting the number of labs that can be created and how long they run.

# Summary

- **Azure DevOps Services**: Comprehensive suite for managing every stage of the software development lifecycle.
- **GitHub and GitHub Actions**: Ideal for developers contributing to open-source projects, with robust tools for CI/CD and workflow automation.
- **Azure DevTest Labs**: Helps manage virtual machines for testing across different environments, with cost-control features for efficient resource use.
