# Azure Monitoring Solutions

When identifying their product options, several basic questions or concerns face all companies that use the Cloud:

- Are we using the Cloud correctly?
- Can we squeeze more performance out of our Cloud spend?
- Are we spending more than we need to?
- Do we have our systems properly secured?
- How resilient are our resources?
- If we experience a regional outage, could we fail over to another region?
- How can we diagnose and fix issues that occur intermittently?
- How can we quickly determine the cause of an outage?
- How can we learn about planned downtime?

Fortunately, by using a combination of monitoring solutions on Azure, you can gain answers, insights, and alerts to help ensure that you've optimized your Cloud usage, ascertain the root cause of unplanned issues, and prepare ahead of time for planned outages. At a high level, there are three primary Azure monitoring offerings: **Azure Advisor**, **Azure Monitor**, and **Azure Health Service**. Each of these is aimed at a specific audience and use case and provides a diverse set of tools, services, and programmatic APIs. Let’s explore each offering:

# Summary

Azure monitoring solutions provide key insights into your Azure environment, helping you optimize usage, improve security, diagnose issues, and prepare for outages:

1. **Azure Advisor**: Helps optimize performance, cost, security, and reliability.
2. **Azure Monitor**: Collects, analyzes, and acts on data from your entire environment.
3. **Azure Service Health**: Notifies about incidents, planned maintenance, and provides detailed reports for outage resolution.

With these tools, you can ensure your Azure resources are running efficiently and are prepared for any unforeseen issues.

# Azure Management Tools

At a high level, there are two broad categories of management tools: **visual tools** and **code-based tools**. 

- **Visual tools** provide visually friendly access to all the functionality of Azure. However, they might be less useful when you're trying to set up a large deployment of resources with interdependencies and configuration options.
- **Code-based tools** are usually the better choice when you need to quickly set up and configure Azure resources. While it may take some time to learn the right commands and parameters, once you have them, they can be saved into files and used repeatedly.

The advantage of using code is that it can be stored, versioned, and maintained along with application source code in a source code management tool, such as **Git**. This approach to managing hardware and cloud resources is referred to as **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.

---

## Two Approaches to Infrastructure as Code

There are two approaches to Infrastructure as Code:

1. **Imperative Code**: Details each individual step that should be performed to achieve a desired outcome.
2. **Declarative Code**: Details only the desired outcome and allows an interpreter to decide how to best achieve that outcome.

The distinction is important because tools based on **declarative code** offer a more robust approach to deploying dozens or hundreds of resources simultaneously and reliably.

## Azure Management Tools

Microsoft offers a variety of tools and services to manage your cloud environment, each designed for different scenarios and users.

### 1. Azure Portal

The **Azure Portal** is a web-based user interface that provides visually friendly access to virtually every feature of Azure. It allows you to:

- View all the services you're using
- Create new services
- Configure your services
- View reports

The Azure portal is the starting point for most users, but as your Azure usage grows, you might prefer a more repeatable, code-centric approach to managing your Azure resources.

### 2. Azure Mobile App

The **Azure Mobile App** provides iOS and Android access to your Azure resources when you're away from your computer. With this app, you can:

- Monitor the health and status of your Azure resources
- Check for alerts
- Quickly diagnose and fix issues
- Restart web apps or virtual machines

### 3. Azure PowerShell

**Azure PowerShell** is a shell that developers, DevOps, and IT professionals use to execute commands called **cmdlets**. These commands call the **Azure REST API** to perform management tasks in Azure. Key points about Azure PowerShell include:

- Cmdlets can be executed independently or combined into a script.
- The script can be used to automate routine setup, teardown, and maintenance tasks for a single resource or multiple connected resources.
- Available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and can be accessed in a web browser via **Azure Cloud Shell**.

Azure PowerShell is particularly useful for Windows-centric IT organizations that have built up custom scripts and commandlets over time.

### 4. Azure CLI

The **Azure CLI** is an executable program for developers, DevOps professionals, or IT professionals to execute commands in **Bash**. These commands, like PowerShell, call the Azure REST API. Key points about the Azure CLI include:

- Similar to Azure PowerShell in functionality.
- You can run commands independently or combine them into a script for automation.
- Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac and can be accessed via **Azure Cloud Shell**.

The primary difference between Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell is the syntax. If you are proficient in PowerShell or Bash, you can choose the tool that suits your skillset.

### 5. Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates

While it's possible to write imperative code in Azure PowerShell or the Azure CLI to set up and tear down resources, **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates** offer a better solution. ARM templates allow you to describe the resources you want to use in a **declarative JSON format**. 

#### Benefits of ARM Templates:
- The entire ARM template is verified before any code is executed to ensure the resources are created and connected correctly.
- Resources are orchestrated and created in parallel (for example, 50 instances of the same resource can be created at the same time).
- The developer only needs to define the desired state and configuration of each resource in the ARM template, and the template handles the rest.
- ARM templates can even execute PowerShell and Bash scripts before or after the resource setup.

# Summary

In managing Azure resources, you have the choice of visual or code-based tools, depending on your use case. 

- **Visual tools** (like the Azure portal) provide a user-friendly interface for managing resources.
- **Code-based tools** (such as Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and ARM templates) offer a more repeatable, automatable approach that is especially useful for managing complex infrastructures.

By using these tools effectively, you can automate, version, and maintain your Azure infrastructure in a consistent and efficient way.
