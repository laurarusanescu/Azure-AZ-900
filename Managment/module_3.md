# Azure Serverless Technology and IoT

## Serverless Computing in Azure
- **Azure Functions**:  
  - Serverless compute service to run event-driven code.  
  - Ideal for pulling logic from existing services, e.g., when converting a C# Windows service to the cloud.  

- **Azure Logic Apps**:  
  - A workflow automation service to integrate apps, data, and services.  
  - Best suited for orchestrating workflows, e.g., automating processes for customer retention after negative shopping experiences.  

### Key Benefits of Serverless Computing:
- Eliminates the need to manage infrastructure, allowing focus on code and workflows.  
- Automatically scales resources based on demand.  
- Reduces costs by avoiding over-provisioning or under-utilization of resources.  
- Simplifies development by eliminating the need for custom code to achieve scalability and workflow management.

## IoT Services in Azure
- **Azure IoT Hub**:  
  - Enables device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device communication.  
  - Used for collecting and managing telemetry data from connected devices.  
  - Combines telemetry data with machine learning for predictive maintenance.  

- **Azure IoT Central**:  
  - Fully managed IoT app platform for real-time logistics and tracking systems.  
  - Includes templates like the Connected Logistics Starter for ease of deployment.  

- **Azure Sphere**:  
  - Provides secure IoT solutions for hardware like modern point-of-sale terminals.  
  - Ensures security for connected devices and simplifies updates with built-in firmware management.  

### Key Benefits of Azure IoT Services:
- Enables secure, real-time communication with IoT devices.  
- Reduces the need for custom development of dashboards or reporting tools.  
- Simplifies the process of pushing software and firmware updates to devices.  
- Enhances security for device-driven solutions.
