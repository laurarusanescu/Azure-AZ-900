# Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure

Tailwind Traders needs to control its cloud environment to ensure compliance with several industry standards. To begin, the organization has business requirements related to on-premises workloads that must be met for workloads running in the cloud. To help navigate this, we can use the **Cloud Adoption Framework** to define and implement the governance strategy. 

## What is the Cloud Adoption Framework?
The **Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure** provides guidance, tools, documentation, and proven practices to help organizations succeed in their cloud adoption journey. It consists of several stages:

1. **Define Your Strategy**
2. **Make a Plan**
3. **Ready Your Organization**
4. **Adopt the Cloud**
5. **Govern and Manage Your Cloud Environment**

### Stage 1: Define Your Strategy
In this stage, you’ll define the motivations behind moving to the cloud and determine your desired outcomes. This step helps you align the cloud adoption strategy with business goals.

#### Key Steps:
- **Document Your Motivations**: Meet with stakeholders and leadership to determine why you're moving to the cloud. Common reasons include scaling to meet demand, reducing costs, or increasing business agility.
- **Develop a Business Case**: Involve key groups such as finance, marketing, and HR to document your business goals and ensure that moving to the cloud gives a good return on investment (ROI).
- **Choose the Right First Project**: Select a project that is achievable but demonstrates progress toward cloud migration goals.

### Stage 2: Make a Plan
This stage involves mapping your business and technical goals to specific actions. A detailed plan ensures your efforts align with the desired business outcomes.

#### Key Steps:
- **Digital Estate**: Inventory the existing assets and workloads that you plan to migrate to the cloud.
- **Organizational Alignment**: Ensure the right people are involved in the migration process, both technically and from a governance standpoint.
- **Skills Readiness Plan**: Develop a plan to ensure that individuals within your organization build the skills they need to operate in the cloud.
- **Cloud Adoption Plan**: Create a comprehensive plan that brings development, operations, and business teams together to achieve cloud adoption.

### Stage 3: Ready Your Organization
In this stage, you'll create a **landing zone**, an environment in the cloud where you can begin hosting your workloads. This includes setting up the right governance, security, and financial controls to ensure proper management.

#### Key Steps:
- **Create a Landing Zone**: Set up an environment in Azure for hosting workloads, with cloud infrastructure, governance, and security capabilities.
- **Refine Your Landing Zone**: Ensure that it meets operational, governance, and security needs. Start with recommended best practices to ensure scalability and maintainability.

### Stage 4: Adopt the Cloud
The **adopt phase** involves migrating applications to the cloud and modernizing them as needed. You may also begin innovating and developing new solutions that leverage cloud capabilities.

#### Key Steps:
- **Migrate Applications**: Use the **Azure Migration Guide** to deploy your first project to the cloud. Utilize the **Azure Cloud Migration Best Practices Checklist** to ensure the migration follows recommended practices and scales efficiently.
- **Innovate**: Establish a business value consensus and ensure that any new developments align with customer needs. Use the **Azure Innovation Guide** to accelerate the development of new ideas and build a minimum viable product (MVP).

### Stage 5: Govern and Manage Your Cloud Environment
The **governance and management phase** ensures that cloud environments are managed properly as they evolve over time. It’s important to continuously optimize the cloud governance processes and policies.

#### Governance:
- **Define a Methodology**: Establish a methodology for incremental steps to implement full cloud governance.
- **Governance Benchmark Tool**: Assess the current and future state of your governance process. Use this tool to establish a vision for applying governance frameworks.
- **Iterate on Governance Controls**: Continuously improve governance controls, addressing tangible risks as you move toward the end-state solution.

#### Management:
- **Establish a Management Baseline**: Define the minimum tools and processes to apply to every asset in your environment. Document supported workloads and set operational commitments with the business.
- **Apply Best Practices**: Continuously iterate on your management baseline and perform deeper architecture reviews for workloads requiring higher levels of business commitment.

By following these steps, Tailwind Traders can ensure that its cloud adoption journey is aligned with business needs, industry standards, and governance requirements.

# Azure Hierarchical Structure

In the first course of this series, you learned that the hierarchical structure for an organization's resources in Azure has four levels: **Resources**, **Resource Groups**, **Subscriptions**, and **Management Groups**. Let's take a brief look at each of these levels.

### 1. Resources
Resources are instances of services that you create, such as virtual machines, storage, or SQL databases. These are the building blocks of your Azure environment.

### 2. Resource Groups
A **resource group** is a logical container where Azure resources like web apps, databases, and storage accounts are deployed and managed. Resource groups help organize resources in a way that makes it easier to manage, monitor, and secure them.

### 3. Subscriptions
A **subscription** groups together user accounts and the resources created by those users. For each subscription, there are limits or quotas on the amount of resources that you can create and use. Subscriptions are useful for managing costs and resource allocation for different teams, projects, or departments. You can create one billing report per subscription, which can be used for chargebacks or internal cost tracking. 

When considering your subscription strategy, you should account for:
- **Billing**: How costs will be tracked, for example, by department or project.
- **Access Control**: Subscriptions are associated with an **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)** tenant, where administrators can manage access using **Azure role-based access control (RBAC)**.
- **Subscription Limits**: Each subscription has resource limitations, such as the maximum number of **Azure ExpressRoute circuits** per subscription (which is 10). It's important to consider these limits during your design phase. If you need to exceed the limits, you might have to add more subscriptions.

### 4. Management Groups
**Management groups** help you manage access, policies, and compliance across multiple subscriptions. All subscriptions under a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to that group, making it easier to apply governance across a large organization. You'll learn more about management groups later in this module.

### Cloud Governance Strategy: Subscription Level

At the beginning of any cloud governance implementation, you need to define a cloud organization structure that meets your business needs. This step typically involves forming a **Cloud Center of Excellence (CoE)** team (also called a cloud enablement team or cloud custodian team). This team is responsible for implementing governance practices across the organization.

Often, teams start their governance strategy at the **subscription** level, focusing on:
1. **Billing**
2. **Access Control**
3. **Subscription Limits**

By designing a subscription architecture that aligns with your business and operational requirements, you can ensure that your Azure environment is well-organized, secure, and cost-effective.

# Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Organizations need to control who has access to their resources, and this applies to the Cloud environment as well. Azure **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** simplifies the process of defining access rights for users, groups, and applications. The goal is to grant users only the rights they need to perform their job and restrict access to the relevant resources.

## What is Azure RBAC?
Azure RBAC is the system that allows control over who has access to which Azure resources and what actions they can perform on those resources. Access control is achieved by assigning roles to users, groups, or applications at a particular scope. A **role** is a collection of permissions, and **scope** refers to the set of resources that the access applies to.

### Scopes in Azure RBAC
Azure roles can be assigned at four levels of scope:
1. **Management Group** - A collection of multiple subscriptions.
2. **Subscription** - A grouping of user accounts and their resources.
3. **Resource Group** - A logical container for Azure resources.
4. **Resource** - Individual resources like virtual machines or databases.

Scopes are structured in a parent-child hierarchy, with each level making the scope more specific. Roles can be assigned at any of these levels, allowing you to control access at various layers of your environment.

## Built-In Azure Roles
Some of the built-in roles in Azure include:
- **Reader**: Can view resources but cannot make any changes.
- **Contributor**: Can manage resources, but cannot assign roles.
- **Owner**: Has full access to manage all resources, including assigning roles.

If the built-in roles don't meet your organization's needs, you can create custom roles tailored to your specific requirements.

### Examples of Role Assignments
- **Owner Role at Management Group**: The user has full access to manage everything in all subscriptions within the management group.
- **Reader Role at Subscription Scope**: The user or group can view any resource group and resource within the subscription.
- **Contributor Role at Resource Group Scope**: The user or application can manage resources within a specific resource group, but not other groups.

## How is Azure RBAC Enforced?
Azure RBAC is enforced on actions initiated against an Azure resource that passes through **Azure Resource Manager (ARM)**. ARM provides a way to organize and secure cloud resources. Azure RBAC does not enforce access permissions at the application or data level; application security must be handled separately by the application.

### Azure RBAC Allow Model
Azure RBAC uses an **allow model** for access control. When assigned a role, users can perform certain actions like read, write, or delete on resources within the specified scope. The **allow model** is cumulative, meaning if one role grants read permissions and another grants write permissions, the user will have both read and write access.

## Role Assignment Scenarios
Here are some common scenarios you can implement with Azure RBAC:
- Allow a user to manage virtual machines and another user to manage the virtual network.
- Allow a **database administrator group** to manage SQL databases in a subscription.
- Allow a user to manage all resources in a resource group, such as virtual machines, websites, and subnets.
- Allow an **application** to access all resources within a resource group.

The complete list of built-in roles can be found at the end of this module.

## Role Assignments and Scope
A **role assignment** is the process of attaching a role to a **security principal** (user, group, service principal, or managed identity) at a particular scope. This grants access to Azure resources. When assigning a role to a **group**, all users within that group inherit the role. Roles can also be assigned to other identity types like **service principals** and **managed identities**, which are used by applications and services to automate access to Azure resources.

### Tailwind Traders: Role-Based Access Control Setup
Tailwind Traders has multiple teams with distinct roles in managing IT resources. Here’s how you can manage RBAC for them:
- **IT Administrators**: Full control of all resources, including backups and disaster recovery.
- **Cost and Billing Team**: Manages cloud-related spending and internal budgets.
- **Security Operations Team**: Monitors and responds to security incidents, with access to log files and security alerts.

By using Azure RBAC, you can ensure that users and teams are granted only the specific permissions they need to perform their tasks.

## Managing Access with Azure RBAC
You can manage access permissions through the **Access Control (IAM)** pane in the Azure portal. In the example below, **Alicia Home** has been assigned the **Backup Operator** role for a specific resource group. The Access Control pane shows who has access to what scope and the roles applied to them. You can also grant or remove access from this pane.

This approach helps you enforce the principle of least privilege by providing access only to those who need it.
# Azure Resource Locking

As an additional layer of access control, Azure provides **resource locks** to prevent critical resources from being accidentally deleted or changed. Even with Azure RBAC policies in place, there is still a risk that users with the appropriate permissions could delete or modify essential Cloud resources. Think of a resource lock as a safeguard that prevents unauthorized modifications to your resources.

## What is Azure Resource Locking?
A **resource lock** is a mechanism that prevents accidental deletion or changes to a resource. For example, an **IT Administrator** at **Tailwind Traders** was performing routine cleanup of unused resources but accidentally deleted resources that were critical to an application used for seasonal promotions. This could have been avoided with resource locks.

## How Resource Locks Work
As an administrator, you can lock a **subscription**, **resource group**, or **individual resource** to prevent others from accidentally deleting or modifying critical resources. Here’s how to apply resource locks:

- Navigate to the **settings section** of any resource's settings pane in the **Azure portal**.
- Resource locks can also be managed via **PowerShell**, **Azure CLI**, or an **Azure Resource Manager template**.

### Lock Levels
Resource locks have two main types of lock levels:
1. **Cannot Delete**: Authorized users can read and modify a resource but cannot delete it without first removing the lock.
2. **Read-Only**: Authorized users can read a resource but cannot delete or modify it. This lock level is similar to the **Reader** role in Azure RBAC.

Applying a **read-only** lock restricts users to permissions granted by the **Reader role** in Azure RBAC.

## Modifying Locked Resources
Although resource locks prevent accidental changes, modifications can still be made by following a two-step process:
1. **Remove the lock**: To modify a locked resource, you must first remove the lock.
2. **Apply the desired action**: After the lock is removed, you can perform the action permitted by your RBAC permissions.

This two-step process ensures that any change is intentional, thus protecting administrators from making unintended changes.

### Important Notes on Resource Locks
- **Resource locks apply regardless of RBAC permissions**: Even if you're an owner of the resource, you must remove the lock before performing the blocked action.
- **Accidental lock removal**: If a cloud administrator accidentally deletes a resource lock, its associated resources can be modified or deleted. This is a potential risk, so it's essential to safeguard against lock removal.

## Combining Resource Locks with Azure Blueprints
To further strengthen the protection of critical resources, you can combine **resource locks** with **Azure Blueprints**. Azure Blueprints allow you to define a set of standard Azure resources that your organization requires. For example, you can create a blueprint that ensures a specific resource lock is in place. If the lock is removed, Azure Blueprints can automatically restore it, providing additional assurance that resources are protected.

You will learn more about **Azure Blueprints** later in this module.
