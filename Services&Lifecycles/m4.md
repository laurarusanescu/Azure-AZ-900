# Understanding Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Cloud Migration

Before **Tailwind Traders** migrates to the Cloud, they need to understand their current data center expenses. Having a clear understanding of the current costs will help them evaluate what Cloud migration will mean in terms of financial impact. One tool that can assist in this process is the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator**.

## What is the TCO Calculator?
The **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator** helps you estimate the cost savings of operating your solution on **Azure** over time, compared to running it on-premises in your own data center. 

TCO is a common term used in finance, and it helps identify all the hidden costs related to maintaining on-premises infrastructure, such as:
- Software licenses
- Hardware
- IT labor costs
- Electricity

By using the TCO calculator, Tailwind Traders can estimate these costs for their on-premises workloads and compare them with the expected costs of running the same workloads on **Azure**.

### How Does the TCO Calculator Work?
The TCO calculator process involves three key steps:
1. **Define Your Workloads**
2. **Adjust Assumptions**
3. **View the Report**

#### Step 1: Define Your Workloads
In this step, you enter the specifications of your on-premises infrastructure into the TCO calculator. You will define workloads in these four categories:
- **Service Category**: Operating systems, virtualization methods, CPU cores, and memory (RAM).
- **Databases Category**: Database types, server hardware, and the Azure service you want to use, including the expected number of concurrent users.
- **Storage Category**: Storage type and capacity, including backup and archive storage.
- **Networking Category**: Amount of network bandwidth consumed in your on-premises environment.

#### Step 2: Adjust Assumptions
In this step, you will adjust assumptions about your operating costs. For example, you can specify:
- Whether your current on-premises licenses are enrolled for software assurance, which can save money when reused on Azure.
- If you need to replicate storage to another Azure region for greater redundancy.
- Key operating cost assumptions across various areas, including:
  - Electricity price per kilowatt-hour
  - Network maintenance cost as a percentage of network hardware/software costs
  - Hourly pay rate for IT administration

These costs are based on data certified by **Nucleus Research**, and you can adjust them to more accurately reflect your current infrastructure.

#### Step 3: View the Report
Once you've defined your workloads and adjusted your assumptions, you can generate a report. In this step:
- Choose a time frame for analysis (between **1** and **5 years**).
- The calculator generates a side-by-side comparison of the cost breakdown for operating the workloads on-premises versus on Azure. The categories covered include:
  - Compute
  - Data Center
  - Networking
  - Storage
  - IT Labor

You can download, share, or save this report for later review.

## Conclusion
The TCO calculator helps **Tailwind Traders** understand the total cost of running workloads in their current data center versus the costs of running them on Azure. By using this tool, they can make more informed decisions about their Cloud migration.
# Understanding Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a formal agreement between a service company and the customer that defines the performance standards the service provider commits to. For **Azure**, the SLA defines the performance expectations that Microsoft guarantees for the services you use. Understanding the SLAs for each Azure service is important because it helps you manage expectations and ensures your application’s performance aligns with your business needs.

### Why SLAs Matter
When you build applications on Azure, the availability of the services you use impacts your application’s performance. By understanding the SLAs for the services you rely on, you can set realistic expectations with your customers regarding availability, downtime, and other performance factors.

Later, you'll learn about strategies to adopt when an Azure SLA does not meet your specific requirements.

### Finding Azure SLAs
Each Azure service has its own SLA, and these are publicly available on the **Service Level Agreements** section of the [Azure website](https://azure.microsoft.com). You can search for the SLA of a specific service such as **Azure Database for MySQL**. 

### Components of an SLA
A typical Azure SLA includes the following sections:
1. **Introduction**: This section explains the scope of the SLA and outlines terms related to subscription renewals.
2. **General Terms**: Defines terms used throughout the SLA (e.g., downtime incidents, error codes) and includes the agreement's conditions, such as how to submit claims and what credit you’ll receive for performance issues.
3. **SLA Details**: This section describes the specific guarantees, such as uptime and connectivity. Performance commitments, usually in the form of percentages (e.g., 99.9% or 99.99%), are key in this section. 

### Azure Database for MySQL SLA Example
For instance, **Azure Database for MySQL** guarantees **99.99% uptime** (also called "four nines" uptime). This means that the service is guaranteed to be operational 99.99% of the time. 

#### Downtime Calculation
Although the difference between 99.9% and 99.99% uptime might seem small, the total downtime is significantly reduced as the SLA percentage increases. Here’s how the downtime is calculated:

| SLA Percentage | Total Downtime per Year |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| 99.0%          | 8.76 hours              |
| 99.9%          | 8.76 hours              |
| 99.99%         | 5.26 minutes            |
| 99.999%        | 5.26 minutes            |

This is cumulative, meaning that multiple outages would be combined into total downtime.

### Service Credits for SLA Violations
If a service fails to meet the SLA, you may be eligible for a **service credit**. This is a percentage of your service fees credited back to you based on the severity of the SLA violation. For example:
- **Under 99.00% uptime**: 10% service credit
- **Under 95.00% uptime**: 100% service credit

**Free Products and SLAs**
Free services, such as **Azure Advisor**, typically do not have an SLA. These services provide limited functionality and don’t have financially backed SLAs, as noted in the service agreement.

### Azure Status and Service Health
If you suspect an outage, **Azure Status** provides a global view of the health of Azure services and regions. Azure Status includes an RSS feed for changes to Azure service health, which can be connected to tools like Microsoft Teams or Slack for real-time updates. You can also use **Azure Service Health** for a personalized view of the status of the Azure services you are using, directly from the Azure portal.

### Claiming Service Credits
If Azure services fail to meet their SLA, you must file a claim with Microsoft. For services purchased through a **Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)**, the CSP typically manages the claim process. Each SLA defines the timeline by which you must submit your claim, often by the end of the calendar month following the incident.

### Key Considerations for Tailwind Traders
When planning the migration of Tailwind Traders' services to Azure, understanding the SLAs for each service is crucial. It’s important to review these SLAs to assess whether the uptime, performance, and availability guarantees meet the company’s business needs. Additionally, Tailwind Traders should consider the possibility of downtime and how they can address it by setting up effective **contingency plans**.
