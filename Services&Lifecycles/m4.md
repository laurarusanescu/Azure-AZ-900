# Understanding Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for Cloud Migration

Before **Tailwind Traders** migrates to the Cloud, they need to understand their current data center expenses. Having a clear understanding of the current costs will help them evaluate what Cloud migration will mean in terms of financial impact. One tool that can assist in this process is the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator**.

## What is the TCO Calculator?
The **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator** helps you estimate the cost savings of operating your solution on **Azure** over time, compared to running it on-premises in your own data center. 

TCO is a common term used in finance, and it helps identify all the hidden costs related to maintaining on-premises infrastructure, such as:
- Software licenses
- Hardware
- IT labor costs
- Electricity

By using the TCO calculator, Tailwind Traders can estimate these costs for their on-premises workloads and compare them with the expected costs of running the same workloads on **Azure**.

### How Does the TCO Calculator Work?
The TCO calculator process involves three key steps:
1. **Define Your Workloads**
2. **Adjust Assumptions**
3. **View the Report**

#### Step 1: Define Your Workloads
In this step, you enter the specifications of your on-premises infrastructure into the TCO calculator. You will define workloads in these four categories:
- **Service Category**: Operating systems, virtualization methods, CPU cores, and memory (RAM).
- **Databases Category**: Database types, server hardware, and the Azure service you want to use, including the expected number of concurrent users.
- **Storage Category**: Storage type and capacity, including backup and archive storage.
- **Networking Category**: Amount of network bandwidth consumed in your on-premises environment.

#### Step 2: Adjust Assumptions
In this step, you will adjust assumptions about your operating costs. For example, you can specify:
- Whether your current on-premises licenses are enrolled for software assurance, which can save money when reused on Azure.
- If you need to replicate storage to another Azure region for greater redundancy.
- Key operating cost assumptions across various areas, including:
  - Electricity price per kilowatt-hour
  - Network maintenance cost as a percentage of network hardware/software costs
  - Hourly pay rate for IT administration

These costs are based on data certified by **Nucleus Research**, and you can adjust them to more accurately reflect your current infrastructure.

#### Step 3: View the Report
Once you've defined your workloads and adjusted your assumptions, you can generate a report. In this step:
- Choose a time frame for analysis (between **1** and **5 years**).
- The calculator generates a side-by-side comparison of the cost breakdown for operating the workloads on-premises versus on Azure. The categories covered include:
  - Compute
  - Data Center
  - Networking
  - Storage
  - IT Labor

You can download, share, or save this report for later review.

## Conclusion
The TCO calculator helps **Tailwind Traders** understand the total cost of running workloads in their current data center versus the costs of running them on Azure. By using this tool, they can make more informed decisions about their Cloud migration.
