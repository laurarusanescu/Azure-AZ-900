# Azure Identity Services

## Lesson Overview
This lesson covered **Azure Identity Services** and how they provide identity and access management for cloud-based applications.

---

## Key Concepts
- **Authentication vs. Authorization**:
  - **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or application.
  - **Authorization**: Determining what actions a user or application is allowed to perform after being authenticated.

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**:
  - Provides identity and access management for cloud-based applications.
  - Enables secure access to resources through centralized identity services.

- **Core Features**:
  - **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Simplifies access by allowing users to log in once to access multiple applications.
  - **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds an additional layer of security by requiring two or more forms of verification.
  - **Conditional Access**: Implements policies that enforce access control based on specific conditions (e.g., device type, user location).

## Outcomes
By completing this lesson, you can now:
- Explain the difference between **authentication** and **authorization**.
- Describe how **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** facilitates secure identity and access management.
- Understand the roles of **SSO**, **MFA**, and **Conditional Access** in managing user identities and securing access to applications.
