# Understanding Azure Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

An SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a formal agreement between a service provider and its customer, outlining the performance standards the provider commits to meeting. For Microsoft Azure, SLAs define uptime and connectivity guarantees for each service.

## **Key Concepts from Tailwind Traders’ Example**:

1. **SLA Importance**:
   - Performance guarantees vary depending on the service.
   - Business-critical applications like the main website require higher availability, closer to 100%.
   - Non-critical applications (e.g., the special orders application) can tolerate lower SLAs, as long as functionality and data integrity are preserved.

2. **Designing for SLA Compliance**:
   - **High Availability (HA)**:
     - To maximize uptime for critical applications, Azure recommends deploying multiple instances of the same virtual machine across **different availability zones** in the same region. This approach ensures:
       - Redundancy: If one zone fails, other zones maintain service continuity.
       - Load balancing: Instances share workloads to prevent bottlenecks.
   - **Lower Tolerance for Non-Critical Applications**:
     - For less critical applications like the special orders app, lower SLA thresholds may suffice.
     - Reducing redundancy (e.g., deploying fewer instances) can lower costs while meeting less stringent requirements.

3. **Factors to Consider in SLA Design**:
   - **Business Needs**: Determine the criticality of each application or service and align the SLA accordingly.
   - **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**:
     - Understand the time required to restore a component after a failure.
     - Tailwind Traders, for example, must ensure its retail employees can quickly regain access to the special orders app after disruptions.
   - **Impact of Preview Features**:
     - Azure preview features are in development or testing phases and may not carry formal SLAs.
     - Using such features in production can introduce risk to system reliability and should be carefully evaluated.

## **Steps to Calculate Composite SLA**:

1. **Identify All Azure Services in Your Application**:
   - Sketch or diagram your application, mapping out each Azure service you plan to use.
   - For each service, note its published SLA from the Azure documentation (e.g., Azure Virtual Machines, Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage).

2. **Compute Composite SLA**:
   - The composite SLA of an application depends on the combined SLAs of its components. If multiple services are required simultaneously for the application to function, the composite SLA is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Composite SLA} = \text{SLA(Service A)} \times \text{SLA(Service B)} \times \ldots
     \]
   - For example, if:
     - Service A SLA = 99.9%
     - Service B SLA = 99.95%
     - Composite SLA = \( 0.999 \times 0.9995 = 0.9985 \) (or 99.85%).

3. **Evaluate the Composite SLA**:
   - Compare the composite SLA against your application's requirements.
   - For critical systems, consider how much downtime is acceptable. For example:
     - A 99.9% SLA allows approximately 8.76 hours of downtime annually.
     - A 99.99% SLA reduces downtime to ~52.6 minutes annually.

4. **Improve Composite SLA if Necessary**:
   - To enhance the composite SLA:
     - Add redundancy by deploying resources in multiple availability zones or regions.
     - Use Azure’s premium service tiers, which may offer higher SLAs.
     - Avoid using preview services or features for production workloads.

## **Next Steps for Tailwind Traders**:

1. **Application Planning**:
   - Create a diagram of the application you want to migrate to the cloud, identifying all Azure services involved.
   - Include critical components like virtual machines, storage accounts, and databases.

2. **SLA Research**:
   - Refer to the documented SLAs for each Azure service.
   - Use these values to calculate the composite SLA.

3. **Evaluate SLA Compliance**:
   - Determine if the composite SLA meets your business requirements.
   - If not, make necessary architectural adjustments (e.g., increase redundancy, use higher SLA services).

By carefully considering SLAs and designing with redundancy where needed, Tailwind Traders can ensure its applications meet business-critical performance standards while optimizing for cost and reliability.
